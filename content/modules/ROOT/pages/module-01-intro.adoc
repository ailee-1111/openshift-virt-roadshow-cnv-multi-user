= Virtual Machine Management

== Introduction

The beginning section of this lab will introduce you to the basics of creating and managing VMs in OpenShift Virtualization. Starting with OpenShift 4.18 there is a new Virtualization persona and a tree view for virtual machines that make it easier to visualize and manage your virtualization-based assets. After exploring the UI changes, you will see how the web console guides you through the whole process of creating a virtual machine from a pre-defined template. We will then review the properties of that VM, do some basic customizations, and perform actions like live migration, that are often expected of virtual machine administrators.

.*Goals*

* Create a new virtual machine
* Review and modify resources for virtual machines
* Understand how VM power states are managed using the OpenShift console
* Live migrate a VM between two hosts

As a reminder, here are your credentials for the OpenShift Console:

Your OpenShift cluster console is available {openshift_console_url}[here^].

Your login is available with:

* *User:* {user}
* *Password:* {password}

== Switch to the Virtualization Persona

[[exploring_virt_persona]]
== Exploring OpenShift Virtualization

When you arrive in the Virtualization view you will be on the *Overview* page which provides a high-level view of all virtualization resources currently in use, lets take a moment to explore.

image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/03_Virt_Overview.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: The *Virtualization* persona is available only when Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization is installed and properly configured. In this lab environment the installation and configuration has already been performed for us.

. Click on the *VirtualMachines* item in the left side menu and you will be presented with the virtualization tree view of all VM assets.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/04_Tree_View.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Lets explore this page for a few moments: notice that this view is divided into 3 columns, the left-side management menu, the central column for organization of VM-based projects, and then the virtual machine view.

. The left menu is the main control for Virtualization integrated functions in OpenShift. We can see virtualization related items like the Catalog, Templates and InstanceTypes to build VMs from, and the menus to configure Storage and Netoworking for virtual machines.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/05_Left_Menu.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. The central column as mentioned is a project view. Like other objects in OpenShift, Projects (which are an abstraction for Kubernetes namespaces), are the boundaries for which permissions and other aspects of using and managing the resources are available to a user. By default there is a slider here that only shows projects with existing VMs. Currently the only project that we can see is `vmimported-{user}`, as it is the only project that we have access to with virtual machines.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/06_Project_Tree.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. In the virtual machine overview column, it will list *All projects* by default, which shows us the VM's for every user in our shared cluster environment. You can sort by columns to make locating VM's easier, or even arrange which columns are visable to make organization easier. This will change when you highlight a specific project in the center column.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/07_VM_List.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. From the center column click on the project `vmimported-{user}` to see the virtual machines that are currently deployed and available to your specific user account.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/08_VM_Imported_Project.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
IMPORTANT: While the lab guide is configured to be dynamic and show your specific user account and project names whenever possible, the images in the lab guide are static and may show a different user, please perform these tasks in reference to your own user account and associated projects.

. The virtual machine overview column will update to only show the virtual machines in the `vmimported-{user}` project. You should see three VMs listed, but they are not currently turned on, these are for a later part of the lab.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/09_VMs_Stopped.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[[create_project]]

. Before creating a VM we need to create a new project. Virtual machines are deployed to a specific project, or namespace, where by default, users without permission to the namespace cannot access, manage, or control them. Administrators can access all projects, and therefore view all virtual machines, however regular users must be given access to projects as needed.
+
. Click *Create Project* at the top right of the center tree view column.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/10_Column_Create.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. In the *Name* field, type *vmexamples-{user}* to name the project, then click *Create*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-01-intro/11_Create_Project.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
NOTE: The virtual machine overview column is changed to view this new project immediately, but it does not currently show up in the center column as there are no VMs in the project and we the option to not show it is toggled on by default.


[[create_vm]]
== Create a Linux Virtual Machine

. From the virtual machine overview column, click on the *Create VirtualMachine* button and select *From template* from the drop-down menu.
+
NOTE: VMs can also be created from an InstanceType wizard as well as created by entering a custom YAML definition, but for this current lab scenario we are going to stick with creating VMs based on existing templates.
+
image::spring_2025/module-01-intro/12_Create_VM_Button.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. You will be taken to the *Catalog* screen, where a number of tiles will appear showing the available pre-defined VM templates.
+
Reviewing the list of available templates youâ€™ll notice that some have a blue badge which indicates "Source available". These are templates which are using automatically downloaded and stored template source disks. If you were deploying in your own environment where you can customize the options available, you can modify the availability of these boot sources by default, and/or removing these source disks, in favor of creating custom disks for your organizations needs.
+
image::spring_2025/module-01-intro/13_Create_VM_Templates.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Select the *Fedora VM* tile, and a dialog opens.
+
image::spring_2025/module-01-intro/14_Create_VM_Quick.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Change the name to *fedora01* and press *Quick create VirtualMachine*:
+
image::spring_2025/module-01-intro/15_Create_VM_Quick_Name.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. We will return to our tree view and see information about our new VM in the virtual machine overview column. Notice also that we now see our `vmexamples-{user}` project listed in the center column as it contains a VM, and that it is highlighted within the project. If we watch closely we can see the VM Status switch from *Provisioning* to *Starting* and finally *Running* in the virtual machine overview column when it is ready. During this time, the storage provider has cloned the template disk so that it can be used by the newly created virtual machine. The amount of time this takes can vary based on the storage provider being used to create the boot disk, and the current load on the system.
+
image::spring_2025/module-01-intro/16_Fedora_Running.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Once the virtual machine is running we can do some further exploration of the *Overview* page in the right side column.  
+
* The _Details_ tile shows us 
The IP address of the virtual machine on the software-defined network (SDN) is also displayed on this page, along with information about the storage devices, system utilization, and more. By default VMs are attached to the default pod network. Later in this lab we will explore advanced networking options, and how to customize connectivity for VMs.
+
image::module-01-intro/17_Fedora_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]



. After you are done looking at the VM details, examine the *Events* tab to see some details of the process. If there are any issues with the creation of the VM, they will show up on this tab as well.
+
image::spring_2025/module-01-intro/18_Fedora_Events.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
* A _DataVolume_ is created. _DataVolumes_ are used to manage the creation of a VM disk, abstracting the clone or import process onto OpenShift native storage during the virtual machine's creation flow.
* The _VM_ is started.

+
The IP address of the virtual machine on the software-defined network (SDN) is also displayed on this page, along with information about the storage devices, system utilization, and more. By default VMs are attached to the default pod network. Later in this lab we will explore advanced networking options, and how to customize connectivity for VMs.
+

[[admin_vms]]
== Administering Virtual Machines

Administering and using virtual machines is more than simply creating and customizing their configuration. As the platform administrator, we also need to be able to control the VM states and trigger live migrations so that we can balance resources, perform maintenance tasks, and reconfigure nodes.

. Click the *Configuration* tab, this is the entry point to obtain information about the resources of the Virtual Machine.
+
image::module-01-intro/11_Configuration_Tab_Nav.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
It includes seven subtabs:
+
image::module-01-intro/12_Configuration_Tab.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
* *Details*: This tab presents all of the physical features of the VM in a single panel. From here you can make edits to various descriptors and basic hardware configurations including modifying the cpu or memory, changing the hostname, attaching passthrough devices, and modifying the boot order.
* *Storage*: This tab lists the disks attached to the system and allows you to add new disks to the system. If the guest is configured with the agent, it lists the filesystems and the utilization. Here it is possible to attach _ConfigMaps_, _Secrets_, and _Service Accounts_ as extra disks. This is useful when passing configuration data to the application(s) running in the virtual machine.
* *Network*: This Tab shows the current network interfaces configured for the VM and allows for you to add new ones.
* *Scheduling*: This tab includes advanced configuration options indicating where the VM should run and the strategy to follow for eviction. This tab is used to configure (anti)affinity rules, configure node selectors and tolerations, and other behaviors that affect which cluster nodes the VM can be scheduled to.
* *SSH*: This tab allows you to configure remote access to the machine by creating an SSH service on a configured load-balancer, or by injecting public SSH keys if the feature is enabled.
* *Initial run*: This tab allows us to configure _cloud-init_ for Linux or _sys-prep_ for Microsoft Windows, including setting the commands to be executed on the first boot, such as the injection of SSH keys, installation of applications, network configuration, and more.
* *Metadata*: This tab shows current Labels and Annotations applied to the virtual machine. Modifying these values can help us tag our machines for specific purposes, or help us enable automated workflows by uniquely identifying machines.

. List the disks associated with the VM by clicking on the *Storage* tab:
+
image::module-01-intro/13_Storage_Tab.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
In this environment, the default StorageClass, which defines the source and type of storage used for the disk, is called *ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd*. This storage is the default type provided by OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) for running virtual machines. Each storage provider has different storage classes that define the characteristics of the storage backing the VM disk.

. Examine the network interfaces attached to the VM by clicking on the *Network* subtab:
+
image::module-01-intro/14_Network_Tab.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
When a VM is created, an interface on the *PodNetworking* network of type *masquerade* is created by default. This connects the VM to the SDN and provides access from the VM to outside the OpenShift cluster. Other VMs, and Pods, in the cluster can access the virtual machine using this interface. Furthermore, a VM connected to the SDN can be accessed externally using a Route, or Service with type load balancer, or even have a Network Attachment Definition configured to allow direct access to external networks.

[[vm_state]]
== Controlling Virtual Machine State

As a user with permission to access Virtualization, you can stop, start, restart, pause, and unpause virtual machines from the web console.

. Click the *Overview* tab to return to the summary screen.

. In the top right corner you will notice shortcut buttons for running state: stop, restart, and pause. As well as a dropdown menu title *Actions*.
+
image::module-01-intro/15_VM_State_Actions.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
.. *Stop*: Starts a graceful shutdown of the Virtual Machine.
.. *Restart*: This will send a signal to the operating system to reboot the Virtual Machine. Guest integrations are needed for this to work properly.
.. *Pause*: The process is frozen without further access to CPU resources and I/O, but the memory used by the VM at the hypervisor level will stay allocated.

. You can also access these options and more by clicking on the *Actions* menu and seeing the options available in the drop down list.
+
image::module-01-intro/16_VM_Actions_Menu.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Press the *Stop* button and wait until the Virtual Machine is in state *Stopped*.
+
image::module-01-intro/17_VM_Stopped.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
. Clicking on *Actions*, the option *Start* appears, and the options *Restart* and *Pause* are greyed out.
+
image::module-01-intro/18_VM_Actions_List_Stopped.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click *Start*, and wait for the *Running* status.

. Using the *Actions* menu, or the shortcut button, press the *Pause* option. The Virtual Machine state will change to *Paused*.
+
image::module-01-intro/19_VM_Actions_Paused.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Unpause the Virtual Machine using the *Actions* menu and the option *Unpause*, or by using the shortcut button.

[[live_migrate]]
== Live Migrate a Virtual Machine

In this section, we will migrate the VM from one OpenShift node to another without shutting down the VM. Live migration requires *ReadWriteMany* (RWX) storage so that the VM disks can be mounted on both the source and destination nodes at the same time. OpenShift Virtualization, unlike other virtualization solutions, does not use monolithic datastores mounted to each cluster member that hold many VM disks for many different VMs. Instead, each VM disk is stored in its own volume that is only mounted when and where it's needed.

. Navigate to the *Overview* tab to see where the worker node is running:
+
image::module-01-intro/20_VM_Info_Node.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
[NOTE]
====
Only cluster administrators can see the Node - the screenshot is an example of what an admin would see. But you can still migrate the VM - you just won't see the node change.
====

. Using the *Actions* menu, select the option to *Migrate* -> *Compute*.
+
image::module-01-intro/21_VM_Dialog_Migrate.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. After a few seconds, the VM will change the status to *Migrating*, and you can follow it's progress. When it is complete it will return to the *Running* status, but on a new node.
+

image::module-01-intro/23_PodLink.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. If you would like to see the guest switch nodes in real time, you can do so on the *Pod Details* screen by clicking on the pod name on the right. You can see the node the VM lives on, and it's new node when it changes. The cutover is fairly quick, so watch closely. Blink and you may miss it!
+
image::module-01-intro/24_Pod.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

== Summary

In this lab, we reviewed virtual machine state management tasks, and executed a live migration of a VM. Both of these are common and necessary tasks as platform administrators and a great way to familiarize yourself with some basic features available when working with VMs in OpenShift Virtualization.
