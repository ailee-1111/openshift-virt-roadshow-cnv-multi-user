=  Network Management for Virtual Machines

== Introduction

By default, all virtual machines are attached to the OpenShift software-defined network (SDN), which enables access from other workloads on the OpenShift cluster, including other VMs and any OpenShift native applications.

* The SDN provides additional features for abstracting, connecting, and exposing applications in a controlled manner, whether deployed as VMs or Pods in the cluster. These include the `Service` and `Route` features of OpenShift.
* OpenShift's network policy engine allows the VM user or administrator to create rules which allow or deny network traffic to and from individual VMs or entire projects/namespaces.

However, virtual machines may also connect directly to one or more physical networks, such as untagged network or VLANs, when needed. This is in addition to the SDN, which means that, for example, the administrator can connect to the VM from an external IP address and VMs can connect directly using a Layer2 network.

At a high level, this is done by configuring the host networking, such as a Linux bridge. This workshop segment will walk through the next step in that process, creating a network attachment definition to allow VMs to connect to that bridge and, therefore, directly to the physical network. 

[NOTE]
The OpenShift environment has already been configured with a Linux Bridge on each compute node your virtual machines will connect to, thus allowing for easy connectivity with/from outside network resources.

== Review environment

The *Kubernetes NMState Operator* provides a Kubernetes API for performing state-driven network configuration across the OpenShift Container Platform cluster's nodes with NMState. The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides users with functionality to configure various network interface types, DNS, and routing on cluster nodes. Additionally, the daemons on the cluster nodes periodically report on the state of each node's network interfaces to the API server.

. From the OpenShift console, navigate to *Networking* -> *NodeNetworkState* to review the configuration.

== Create Network Attachment Definition

In order to use the Linux Bridge with your VM you need to create a *Network Attachment Definition*. This is what tells OpenShift about the network and allows the virtual machines to connect to it. Network Attachment Definitions are specific to the project/namespace they're created in, unless they're created in the `default` project. This gives you, the administrator, the ability to control which networks are and aren't available to users who have access to manage their own Vms. Once the Network Attachment Definition has been created, it can then be used by virtual machines when configuring their network adapters.

[NOTE]
A network attachment definition instructs openshift to utilise an existing network device. In our case that device was previously created and is named br-flat. You must use that name or OpenShift wonâ€™t be able to place your VM on any compute nodes as it can only utilise nodes with that specifically named network device on it.

. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Network Attachment Definitions* and click *Create network attachment definition*:

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Select project `vmexamples-{user}`.
====

. Complete the form for the `vmexamples` project as follows, then click *Create network attachment definition*:
* *Name*: `flatnetwork`
* *Network Type*: `CNV Linux Bridge`
* *Bridge Name*: `br-flat`
+
image::module-09-networking/06_NetworkAttachDefinition_Create_Form.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
[NOTE]
The form above has an input for `VLAN Tag Number`, which is used when connecting to a network that needs to have a VLAN tag assigned. This lab uses an untagged network, so no VLAN number is required here.
+
A single Linux Bridge on the host can have many different VLANs. In this scenario, you only need to create a Network Attachment Definition for each one, not a separate host interface and bridge.

. Examine the details of the network attachment definition. Because this was created in the `vmexamples-{user}` project, it will not be available in other projects.

== Connect a virtual machine to the external network
. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*, select the `fedora01` VM. Click *Configuration* tab and then click the *Network* left tab:

. Click *Add Network Interface*, complete the form as shown, then click *Save*.
+
Because this is a bridge connecting to the external network, we don't need to rely on any OpenShift features or capabilities to enable access, such as masquerade (NAT) for the virtual machines using the network. As a result, *type* should be `Bridge` here.
+

== User Defined Network

Before the implementation of user-defined networks (UDN), the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin for OpenShift Container Platform only supported a Layer 3 topology on the primary or main network. Due to Kubernetes design principles: all pods are attached to the main network, all pods communicate with each other by their IP addresses, and inter-pod traffic is restricted according to network policy.

UDN improves the flexibility and segmentation capabilities of the default Layer 3 topology for a Kubernetes pod network by enabling custom Layer 2, Layer 3, and localnet network segments, where all these segments are isolated by default. These segments act as either primary or secondary networks for container pods and virtual machines that use the default OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. UDNs enable a wide range of network architectures and topologies, enhancing network flexibility, security, and performance.

A cluster administrator can use a UDN to create and define additional networks that span multiple namespaces at the cluster level by leveraging the ClusterUserDefinedNetwork custom resource (CR). Additionally, a cluster administrator or a cluster user can use a UDN to define additional networks at the namespace level with the UserDefinedNetwork CR.

User-defined networks provide the following benefits:

. Enhanced network isolation for security

.. Tenant isolation: Namespaces can have their own isolated primary network, similar to how tenants are isolated in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). This improves security by reducing the risk of cross-tenant traffic.

. Network flexibility

.. Layer 2 and layer 3 support: Cluster administrators can configure primary networks as layer 2 or layer 3 network types. This provides the flexibility of a secondary network to the primary network.

. Simplified network management

.. Reduced network configuration complexity: With user-defined networks, the need for complex network policies are eliminated because isolation can be achieved by grouping workloads in different networks.

. Advanced capabilities

.. Consistent and selectable IP addressing: Users can specify and reuse IP subnets across different namespaces and clusters, providing a consistent networking environment.

.. Support for multiple networks: The user-defined networking feature allows administrators to connect multiple namespaces to a single network, or to create distinct networks for different sets of namespaces.


=== User Defined Network with OpenShift Virtualization

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to a user-defined network (UDN) on the VM's primary interface by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI. The primary user-defined network replaces the default pod network in your specified namespace. Unlike the pod network, you can define the primary UDN per project, where each project can use its specific subnet and topology.

With the layer 2 topology, OVN-Kubernetes creates an overlay network between nodes. You can use this overlay network to connect VMs on different nodes without having to configure any additional physical networking infrastructure.

The layer 2 topology enables seamless migration of VMs without the need for Network Address Translation (NAT) because persistent IP addresses are preserved across cluster nodes during live migration.

You must consider the following limitations before implementing a primary UDN:

. You cannot use the virtctl ssh command to configure SSH access to a VM.

. You cannot use the oc port-forward command to forward ports to a VM.

. You cannot use headless services to access a VM.

. You cannot define readiness and liveness probes to configure VM health checks.

[NOTE]
OpenShift Virtualization currently does not support secondary user-defined networks.

=== Working with User Defined Network 

You must create the namespace and network before creating pods. Assigning a namespace with pods to a new network or creating a UDN in an existing namespace will not be accepted by OVN-Kubernetes.

This task has to be performed by a cluster administrator. You have assigned a namespace called `vmexamples-{user}-udn` with the proper label (`k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network`)

. Navigate to *Networking* -> *UserDefinedNetworks* and ensure you select the project `vmexamples-{user}-udn`

. Click on *Create* and selet *UserDefinedNetwork*

== Summary

In this module, you explored working with physical networks and connecting Virtual Machines (VMs) directly to an existing network. By attaching VMs to a physical networkâ€”whether untagged or VLAN-taggedâ€”administrators can directly access the VMs while also enabling the VMs to connect to specialized networks, such as storage or administration networks.

User-defined networks provide cluster administrators and users with highly customizable network configuration options for both primary and secondary network types.
